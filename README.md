Personal Learning

Learned how to set up an Angular CLI environment via terminal. Became familiar with the structure and how the pieces fit together. Components, Models, Services etc. Learned how to switch the default CSS setup to SASS based. Basic understanding of the postman application as simple transitions. 


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
